### Dataset
For this project we are using Waymo Open Dataset. [1]
Following is some detail of the dataset mentioned in [2].
The dataset consists of 1150 scenes which are each of 20 seconds span. The scenes consists of well synchronized and calibrated LiDAR and camera data. 
This data is captured in different urban and suburban geographies.

The data is manually annotated with 3D ground truth bounding boxes for LiDAR data and 2D tightly fitting bounding boxes for camera images.
The LiDAR sensor readings are in the form of range images.

The data is divided into 798 training scenes, 202 validation scenes and 150 test scenes.
